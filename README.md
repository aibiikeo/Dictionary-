# Dictionary
The usage of dictionary: As developers, we added several functions to our dictionary such as word translation, definition, and sentence usage
The project advantages: 

1. Stability due to chosen servers which, in theory, should not fall anytime soon. 

2. Simplific interface is user-friendly, so no experience needed to properly use it

3. Not demanding: we tried to minimize the resources used in the project by not installing additional packages, but using manually built functions

4. Ready for updates - our team made the code in such a way so that new features could be added easily by separating function_blocks and leaving the comments

Disadvantages:

1. The amount of resource sites that we used should bot be increasing as it might damage the structure of the code

User guide to our project:

1. Install "pip" packages: BeautifulSoup, googletrans, requests.

2. Copy the source-code into your project in a separate branch to not to invoke the names conflict.

3 The function names such as word, tranlsate, sentence, and enter use their names as the identification of what the function does
